## Alzheimer disease progression detection from longitudional MRI
This is the Pytorch implementation of the paper "Alzheimerâ€™s disease progression detection based on multimodal deep learning model and visual explainability of time series data". 

## Prerequisites:
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [NiBabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/)

## Proposed Framework:
The proposed framework (3D-CNN-BRNN) is composed of four stages. <i>Stage 1</i> shows the image preprocessing step which includes reorientation of the input volume to standard space, intensity inhomogeneity (bias field) correction, MNI template space registration, and skull stripping. <i>Stage 2</i> is 3D CNN module to extract deep features for the input 3D MRI volume. Extracted features are then forwarded to <i>Stage 3</i> that is bidirectional RNN to capture the temporal features from the extracted sequences in <i>Stage 2</i>. In <i>stage 4</i> visual explanation to spatial and temporal features are provided. This step further validates the generalization of the proposed network that is medically acceptable from the domain expert.

## Data prepration:
Please save the MRI ".npy" data into CN and AD folders, respectively. You can use the "data preprocessing/Baseline_volumes.py" for the baseline or "data preprocessing/BaselineMRI + M06MRI_volumes (two_timesteps).py" or BaselineMRI + M06MRI + M12MRI_volumes (three_timesteps).py" to prepare the data for multiple timesteps accordingly.

## Training-Testing:
After data preparation, any model (Proposed network, 3DVGG, 3DResNet) with any data combination can be trained and test with the provided code. Such as code for traininig-testing  proposed network with the baseline MRI data can be found in directory "ProposedNet/ProposedNet_at_BaselineMRI.py".
